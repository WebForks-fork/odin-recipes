        <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>  This fried chicken batter yields the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! It is equally good served hot or cold and has been a picnic favorite in my family for years.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying </li>
            <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided </li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning </li>
            <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed </li>
            <li>2 egg yolks, beaten </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix together 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir together 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a separate bowl; thin mixture with more beer if batter is too thick.</li>
            <li>Moisten chicken pieces with a bit of water, then dip in the dry mixture. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mixture, then dip in the dry mixture once more.</li>
            <li>Fry chicken pieces in hot oil until well-browned and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken pieces and drain on paper towels before serving.</li>
        </ol>
